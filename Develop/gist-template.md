## Regex Components

### Anchors

The ^ anchor is used to signify the string begins with '#'. This is customary in hex codes.

### Quantifiers

The {6} and {3} quantifiers are used with the OR operator to signify that either there will be 6 or 3 alphanumeric characters. A quantifier will match n amount of tokens before it. 

### Grouping Constructs

### Bracket Expressions

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

A pipe (|) functions as a logical OR which means the string with either contain one sets of constraints or another. This is used with the quantifiers {3} and {6} to signify that the hex code will either 3 or 6 alphanumeric characters. The two different constraints will be contained within a capturing group (parenthesis). 

### Flags

### Character Escapes
